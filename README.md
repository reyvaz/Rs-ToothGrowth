## Analyzing the Effect of Vitamin C on Tooth Growth in Guinea Pigs

This is an analysis of the R dataset ToothGrowth which reports the length of odontoblasts in 60 guinea pigs. Each animal received one of three dose levels of vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) by one of two delivery methods, orange juice (OJ) or ascorbic acid (VC).

t-test analyses found that,

1. Higher dosis levels are associated with greater tooth length, independent of delivery method.  

2. At the two lower dose levels (0.5 mg/day and 1.0 mg/day), orange juice is associated with greater tooth length than ascorbic acid.   

3. At the highest dose level (2.0 mg/day), delivery method seems to have no effect.   

The data is available in the R datasets. It was accessed for this analysis on April 24, 2017.
