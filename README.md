## Analyzing the Effect of Vitamin C on Tooth Growth in Guinea Pigs

This is an analysis of the R dataset ToothGrowth which reports the length of odontoblasts in 60 guinea pigs. Each animal received one of three dose levels of vitamin C by one of two delivery methods, orange juice or ascorbic acid.

Performing t-test analyses, it is found that,

1. Higher dosis levels are associated with greater tooth length, independent of delivery method.  

2. At lower dose levels, orange juice is associated with greater tooth length than ascorbic acid.   

3. At the highest dose level, delivery method seems to have no effect.   

The data is available in the R datasets. It was accessed for this analysis on April 24, 2017. 

* The rendered html version of the analysis can be found [here](https://reyvaz.github.io/Rs-ToothGrowth/tooth.html).   

* To recreate the entire analysis simply run [tooth.Rmd](tooth.Rmd) script.
